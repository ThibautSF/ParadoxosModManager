# Paradoxos Mod Manager
Paradoxos Mod Manager is a java application which can be used to manage your mods in recent Paradox Interactive’s games

I developed this app because i often have lots of mods and games with different lists of mods active on Stellaris, and enabling/disabling a bunch of mods for different savegames before i could launch my game was very boring…

## Game supported
* Crusader Kings II
* Europa Universalis IV
* Stellaris
* Hearts of Iron 4
* Imperator Rome

## Requirements
* OS : Windows, Linux, MacOS
* Java 8u40 (at least)
* Supported game(s) and mods installed (*not really necessary but without these, this tool won't really be useful*)
